#. NOTES: Files 'gamedata/game_*.txt' are KGoldrunner DATA files.  They
#. are installed in $KDEDIR/share/apps/kgoldrunner/system and contain
#. names and descriptions of games, plus names and hints for levels.  You
#. may sometimes need to look at the corresponding game or level graphics
#. to work out a good translation (e.g. Initiation 25, Mongolian Horde).
#. 
#. To see any level of any game, run KGoldrunner, click on the New Game button
#. and select the game and level from the list.  If you start to play a level,
#. you will probably need to stop the animation by pressing the Pause key
#. (default Esc or P).
#. 
#. The most urgent translations would be names and hints for the Tutorial
#. games, then the game names and descriptions (as appearing in the main
#. dialog box) and then the other level names and finally the remaining
#. hints, which are intended for experienced players and champions.
#. 
#. Messages marked as NOTi18n should deliberately be left untranslated. The
#. one below is never displayed and others, from time to time, would be long
#. hint texts used by a small number of championship players, left untranslated
#. to economise on translation effort.
#. 
#. The "Das Boot" message in level 97 of the Initiation game is the name of
#. a German submarine warfare movie, left untranslated as a compliment to the
#. original author of KGoldrunner, who is German.  The movie is known as
#. "Das Boot" in many countries, including English-speaking countries.  If it
#. is known by some other name in your country, please include that in your
#. translation of the corresponding hint text.  See this Internet page:
